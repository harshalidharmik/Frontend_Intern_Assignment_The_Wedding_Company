## 📖 Overview

This React-based quiz application presents multiple-choice questions one at a time, tracks progress visually, computes the user's score, and displays a result screen with a smooth counting animation.  
The UI closely matches the design reference shared in the assignment, including soft gradients, rounded cards, smooth shadows, and interactive button states.

A unique touch is added with a **cute paw animation** shown only on the first question screen to encourage the user.
